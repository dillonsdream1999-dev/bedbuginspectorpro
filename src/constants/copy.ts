  // Pin types and details
  PIN_DETAILS: {
    BED_FRAME: {
      title: 'Bed Frame Joint',
      why: 'Bed bugs prefer to hide within 8 feet of where people sleep. Frame joints provide dark crevices close to their food source.',
      signs: 'Look for small dark spots (fecal stains), shed exoskeletons, or live insects in cracks and screw holes.',
    },
    HEADBOARD: {
      title: 'Headboard Mount',
      why: 'The gap between headboard and wall creates an ideal hiding spot with easy access to sleeping areas.',
      signs: 'Check behind the headboard, in mounting hardware, and along the top edge for signs of activity.',
    },
    BASEBOARD: {
      title: 'Baseboard Seam',
      why: 'Baseboards offer protected harborage near beds. Bugs travel along edges and hide in gaps.',
      signs: 'Inspect where baseboard meets floor and wall. Look for dark spots or eggs in cracks.',
    },
    NIGHTSTAND: {
      title: 'Nightstand Zone',
      why: 'Close proximity to sleeping areas makes nightstands a secondary harborage site.',
      signs: 'Check drawer joints, underneath, and where nightstand touches wall or bed.',
    },
    CURTAIN: {
      title: 'Curtain Area',
      why: 'Curtain folds near beds can harbor bed bugs, especially where fabric meets wall or floor.',
      signs: 'Examine curtain hems, folds, and mounting hardware. Look for staining on fabric.',
    },
    OUTLET: {
      title: 'Outlet/Switch Plate',
      why: 'Electrical boxes behind plates provide protected voids that bed bugs may use for harborage.',
      signs: 'Look for signs around plate edges. DO NOT remove covers unless you are qualified.',
    },
    COUCH: {
      title: 'Couch/Sofa Area',
      why: 'Upholstered furniture provides numerous hiding spots in seams, cushions, and frame joints.',
      signs: 'Check cushion seams, under cushions, in folds, and along the frame.',
    },
